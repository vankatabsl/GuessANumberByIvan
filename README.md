# The "Guess a number" game
This is a simple console game "Guess the number". The user is supposed to guess the number the the opponent (a computer in our case) has chosen. The program randomly selects a number beteween 1 and 100.The the player enters one and after that the computer will tell you if it is lower higher or exact.

We used Python libraries
